Something about you
It's like an addiction hit me with your best shot, honey
I've got no reason to doubt you (doubt you)
'Cause certain things hurt and you're my only virtue (virtue)
And I'm virtually yours
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round
Running round my head (my head)
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
There's something about you
It's when you get angry, you have me at your mercy
Oh-oh
And you're like a shoulder to turn to
'Cause certain things mend us when we're hanging on for dear life
We held on so tight (so tight)
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round
Running round my head
And there's certain things that I adore (I'm sorry)
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours (that I'm yours)
Certain that I'm yours, I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
Let's ignore them
Let's ignore them (but I'm certain that I'm yours)
Certain that I'm yours
I adore you, I adore you (certain that I'm yours)
Let's ignore them (let's ignore them)
Let's ignore them (let's ignore them)
I adore you, I adore you (oh-oh)
Oh, I adore you, I adore you
Let's ignore them, let's ignore, yeah-yeah
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
Certain that I'm yours
